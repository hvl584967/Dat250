### Part 1
I had some difficulties while installing MongoDB, but it was mostly just me making mistakes
or other problems with simple solutions.

My custom Map-Reduce can be used to view how much people have spent and can therefore be used to get data about the customers.
It can also be used to give the customer an overview of how much they have spent on the site.

##### Things to improve
A more interesting Map-Reduce that displays the items bought and how much.
I did not manage to do this because i could not find anything that could get data from an array in an array 
while also having a value in the inner array as the key.
